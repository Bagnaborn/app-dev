##Dragonball
**Dragonball** is one of my favorite animes of all time. People from my generation grew up and witnessed *Son Goku's* birth as a low-class Saiyan into one of the most powerful protectors of the universe. He is pure of heart and is even childish at times, but don't underestimate him as he has a wide arsenal of abilities/powers that he has acquired from training and fighting countless villains throughout his lifetime. Some of them include:
-Kamehameha
-Kaioken
-Spirit Bomb
-Solar Flare
-Super Saiyan Transformations
-Instant Transmission
-God Ki
-God Bind
-God Ki Ability: Healing
-Ultra Instinct
